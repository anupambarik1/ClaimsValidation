A: No. Read the summary first, then read details only for features you'll implement.

**Q: Which document should I reference while coding?**  
A: Primarily `IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATES.md` for code, `AI_FEATURES_CHECKLIST.md` for status.

**Q: How often should I update my understanding?**  
A: Re-read the priority sections after completing each feature to adjust your roadmap.

**Q: Can I skip some features?**  
A: Yes, but some have dependencies. Check the "Dependency Graph" before skipping.

**Q: What if my situation is different from these docs?**  
A: The docs provide templates. Adapt them to your specific constraints (budget, timeline, skills).
